# ISAC SHD Venu 2 Watch Face

Inspired by "The Division™" Game from Ubisoft

#### Changes by me
Modified the watchface for the Venu3 only.
Increased time-font by about 10%

Left side: 
Vitality (aka body battery) VIT
Stress level STRS

Right side:
Heartrate HR
Calories Consumption CAL

Bottom
left: temperature, right: chance of rain
underneath: date

Rest is all original and untouched.

# General Idea
The Goal is to Design a Watchface that copys the ISAC Assistant distributed to all Agents

### Plans for the Design
- ISAC still background
- possible moving isac background (Might shave of a lot of battery efficiency tho, gotta get that fixed in a way)
- possible Sound alerts upon different triggers (Freezing temperature, high Heart Rate, etc)

# 🛠️ Known Issues and Bugs
Severity | Symptom | Fix
--|--|--
Annoying/Low | Updates from the IQ Store take a *very* long time to install | writing better code, idk, i need to condense the structure and some bitmaps possibly but that takes time and experience which im both low on. UPDATE ON THAT ONE: Its on garmins side, cant do anything about it

If you find more please open a new issue in this repository, or write me an email to [this Email](mailto:jadre03.2@gmail.com?subject=Issue%20With%20SHDWatchface)

# 🛣️ Roadmap

Getting the Watchface as a normal Watchface to run is the first Priority of course, but theres further things that are possible and might be implemented in a later iteration of the Watchface

### Features that are working
- Ambient Temperature
- Time and Date
- Battery in Percentage
- Percipiation Chance
- Animated Background
- Heart Frequency
- Steps and Stress Level
- Continued Support of newer Models of Watches (especially the Venu Series)
- Custom Font being added and workng correctly 

### Features that are still TODO
- weather forecast
- Weather warning
- BPM Warning
- Stress Warning

# 📢 Information Board

Since i havent worked with Monkey C as of yet and im busy with work and my Apprenticeship this repository might be dormant for a while

### Edit 12/2024:
Theres very little features as of yet, however the Battery efficiency is (understandably) quite high

### Edit 9/2025
The Background animation is working now, battery efficiency is now down again, for me its a recharge every 3 days

### Edit 10/2025
Support for the Venu 2+ and 3 has been added, steps stress and heartrate has been added

### Edit 1 11/2025
Support for Venu 4 in 45 and 41mm Screen Variants, Heartrate moniker changed from BPM to HR

### Edit 2 11/2025
Since i've gotten a User Feedback Email (yes apparently that does happen), ive included the iconic orange ring around the Edge of the Display, ive also added the Ingame font 'Borda' to the Watchface, and now it looks a lot closer to the original  
I also Fixed a small issue regarding the size of the drawable Layers and removed some files from Ressource folders that arent necessary (the Venu 3 does not care for the Venu 2+ Animation File...)

### Edit 03/2026
Ive finished the apprenticeship! I also updated and fixed the way the Watchface reads and uses the Weatherdata. With this the IQ Breaking issue shouldnt occur anymore, and the watchface should be able to run even without a bluetooth connection to the phone
